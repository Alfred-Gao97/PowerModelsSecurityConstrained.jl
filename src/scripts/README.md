# PMSC Scripts

These scripts implement the SCOPF solver that was used in the final event of
the grid optimization competition challenge 1 in October 2019.  The primary
entry point for the solver is `goc_challenge1_huristic_cli.jl`.

These scripts also include the tooling to run the solver on the optimization
competition platform, i.e. `MyJulia1.jl` and `MyJulia2.jl`.
